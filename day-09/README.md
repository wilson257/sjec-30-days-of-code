# Diamond Intuition
Given a non-negative integer `n` representing the "width" of the diamond, print the following pattern with pound signs (#).
- **Preferred language(s): C, C++**

### Topics to learn
- Nested loops.
- Printing whitespaces. 

## Sample Output for width 3

## Sample Output for width 11

- Two adjacent pound signs (#) on the same line must be separated by a **single whitespace.** 

### Input Format
A single integer `n` presenting the "width" of the diamond.
The "width" is the number of pound signs (#) on the widest row of the pattern.

### Input Constraints
1 <= `n` <= 200
